GTAIV .Net Script Hook v1.7.1.7 BETA
(C) 2009 Hazard (hazard_x@gmx.net / twitter.com/HazardX)

based on the GTAIV C++ Script Hook from Aru <oneforaru at gmail dot com>

Classes Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Quaternion and Matrix based on
sourcecode from SlimDX ( www.slimdx.org )


1. Description
--------------

This ASI plugin allows you to run ingame GTAIV scripts written
in any .Net language. Those languages are easy to learn and use,
while they are still extremely powerful.
One noteable aspect of this hook is, that the scripting functions
are organized in a .Net-typical class structure, which makes
finding functions intuitive and easy.
And since you are able to develop scripts with Visual Studio,
you'll get all benefits like code highlighting and IntelliSense.

You need an AsiLoader to use this plugin in GTAIV. See the
Requirements section below for more info.

Special thanks to Aru for his help and for his C++ Script Hook.
This plugin wouldn't be possible without it.

4. Installation
---------------

 - EASY: 

Extract the complete archive into your GTAIV installation folder.


 - DETAILED:

Extract the complete archive into your GTAIV installation folder.
Make sure that the ScriptHookDotNet.asi and ScriptHook.dll files
are in your main GTAIV folder, or any other folder that is
supported by your AsiLoader.

There may already be a ScriptHook.dll present. This is fine,
because many mods use this file. In this case, check which
one of the two files is newer and keep that.

Only the ScriptHookDotNet.asi and ScriptHook.dll files are
required to run scripts.

All files in the "scripts\for Developers" subfolder are only 
required if you want to write own scripts. Look at the "Writing
new scripts" section for more infos on this.


5. Script Installation
----------------------

Scripts for the DotNet Script Hook have to be copied to the
"scripts" subfolder of your GTAIV installation directory.
You may have to create the folder if it is not there.

DotNet scripts may have one of the following file formats:
 *.vb       - for plain VisualBasic.Net scripts
 *.cs       - for plain C# scripts
 *.net      - for compiled scripts in any .Net language
 *.net.dll  - for compiled scripts in any .Net language


6. Writing new scripts
----------------------

Look at the "scripts\for Developers" folder you extracted to
your GTA IV folder earlier. It contains example projects
to start with. You could just edit the vb or cs script files
with Notepad and copy the resulting script to the "scripts"
subfolder of your GTAIV directory.

However, coding will be MUCH more comfortable and easy if you
use Visual Studio 2010 to edit your scripts. Look below for a
free download. Open the SLN Project files with Visual Studio to
get ready-to-compile script examples. Use those examples as a
base for your own scripts.
If you want to create a completely new VS project, make sure
that you add a reference to the included ScriptHookDotNet.dll.
This file is ONLY required for coding. On runtime, your
scripts will automatically use the ScriptHookDotNet.asi that
is located in your GTAIV directory. Thus you don't need to
bundle your script with one of those files when you want to
release it. If you don't want to release the plain  vb or cs
script files, you can use the compiled DLL. You just have to
make sure that the file ends to ".net.dll" or just ".net"!

If a script does not run, take a look at the logfile
ScriptHookDotNet.log . It will write down all errors that
occur during compiling or runtime.

Do NOT include ScriptHookDotNet.asi or ScriptHookDotNet.dll
in the release of your script! Link to this thread instead!

7. Deinstallation
-----------------

Just delete the ScriptHookDotNet.asi from your GTAIV folder.

Scripts contained in the "scripts" subfolder can remain there
if you wish to keep them. They wont run or interfere with the
game when ScriptHookDotNet.asi is deleted.

9. Known Issues
---------------

Not all script functions have been tested. Some of them may not
work as desired or may even lead to crashes.


10. Troubleshooting
-------------------

If you get a "MSVCR100.dll not found" error, install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86):
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84

If you get crashes and are using GTA IV version 1.0.4.0 or older, try to install this
older version of the C++ ScriptHook, which works fine with the current .Net ScriptHook:
